The author of the **Wind Turbine Detection via YOLOv7** dataset developed a wind turbine object detection model using raw LANDSAT and NAIP satellite imagery. The model was based on a transfer learning approach from the state-of-the-art YOLOv7 architecture. The primary goal of this model was to automate on-shore U.S. wind turbine count estimations.

Currently, the U.S. Wind Turbine Database and other state-of-the-art databases that monitor wind turbine development in the United States offer exceptional accuracy but suffer from poor temporal resolution, typically updating quarterly. In contrast, the developed model, when combined with recent satellite imagery data, can provide more frequent and up-to-date estimates of on-shore wind resources in the U.S. This can be of great value for both foreign and domestic investors, as well as government officials, especially in regions undergoing ongoing wind turbine development.
