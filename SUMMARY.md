**Wind Turbine Detection via YOLOv7** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 5215 images with 10063 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Each image in the Wind Turbines 8 dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 1555 (30% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *val* (415 images) and *train* (4800 images). The dataset was released in 2022.
